## Overview

[Titanium](https://github.com/appcelerator/titanium) is a [Command Line Tool (CLI)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) for managing and deploying Titanium mobile applications and modules. It's open-source and easy to use. [We've](https://github.com/appcelertor) designed `titanium` to be suitable for command line beginners, but still be powerful and extensible enough for production usage.

`titanium` requires `npm`, the [node package manager](http://npmjs.org).
